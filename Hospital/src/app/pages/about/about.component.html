            <p class="section-right">In the belief that an institution is only as good as its people, no effort has been spared to bring on board the best of the medical profession across clinical specialties, 
                from around the globe. Our panel of medical experts have painstakingly credentialed and defined each doctor's privileges, ensuring increased patient safety with the provision of high-quality medical services.</p>
               <p class="section-right"> Our doctors are supported by standardised care protocols that help deliver consistent patient care and follow a common treatment plan for a given illness. 
                The talent pool is further strengthened by qualified and well-trained nursing and technical professionals. Our nurses are trained in the latest techniques across various specialties and have implemented global best practices in caregiving.</p>
                <p class="section-right">As a departure from the current prevailing healthcare system in the city of Mumbai, which is dominated by the visiting consultant model, we have followed a Full Time Specialist System since inception. 
                    The FTSS enables us to create a model that is patient-centric with consultants being available throughout the day in the hospital for planned as well as emergency situations. This system is in line with the best practices followed in leading global healthcare institutions.</p>
